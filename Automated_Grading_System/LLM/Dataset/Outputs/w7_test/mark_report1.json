        "result": "**: YES\n\n**Criteria**: Briefly mention different types of scarcity, such as scarcity of natural resources, time scarcity, or scarcity of specific skills or knowledge.\n\n**Student's Solution**: Scarcity isn't a one-size-fits-all concept. Economists recognize different types: scarcity of natural resources like oil or fertile land, where limitations are inherent. Time scarcity refers to the finite hours in a day that force us to prioritize tasks.  Scarcity can also be relative, like the limited pool of highly skilled workers in a specific field, making those skills valuable. Understanding these different types of scarcity helps us make informed decisions in a world of limited resources.<eos>"
