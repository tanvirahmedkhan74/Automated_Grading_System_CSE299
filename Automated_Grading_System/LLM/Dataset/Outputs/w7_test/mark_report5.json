It refers to the limited availability of resources (human effort, raw materials, time) compared to the seemingly endless wants and needs of people. This creates a situation where choices must be made, as we can't have everything we desire. Scarcity forces individuals and societies to prioritize,allocate resources efficiently, and determine what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom. It's the reason why economics is often referred to as \"the science of scarcity.\"<eos>"
